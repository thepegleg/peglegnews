<h3>Latest news</h3>
<h5>9/15/24</h5>
<p>This project is ongoing, contrary to previous statement, and many more updates are planned to come.</p>
<h5>4/20/24</h5>
<p> As a lot of the more local people may know, the school year is coming to an end. But what happens next with thepegleg?</p>
<p>Short version: Development will slow significantly over the summer, and come back in the fall, but probably with less frequency then right now</p>
<p> Long(er) version: Main dev, Cbass92 is going to high school and will probably have less free time to work on this. I plan to involve a younger generation, and keep this project aimed at middle schools. There is a big important doc update coming, and that will probably be the last big update of this year. New games will still be added occasionally. Anywho, that's it for this weeks news. Probable next news: 5/20ish</p>
